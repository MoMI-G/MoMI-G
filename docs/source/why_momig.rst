Why MoMI-G?
===================

There are many genome browsers or SV visualization tools; why does MoMI-G exist?

To our knowledge,MoMI-G is the only SV visualization tool that satisfies the following conditions: 

* (1) allows visualization of (possibly distant) multiple intervals; 
* (2) displays SVs that span multiple intervals; 
* (3) displays SVs at varying scales, i.e., chromosome, gene, and nucleotide scales; 
    * 4a. the chromosome scale view can show the distribution of SVs on one or more chromosomes; 
    * 4b. the gene scale view can show annotations such as exon/intron structures and repeats; 
    * 4c. the nucleotide scale view can show nucleotide-level alignments, in particular, read alignments that correspond to both alleles of heterozygous SVs are shown simultaneously;
* (5) allows users to manually inspect hundreds of SVs. 

MoMI-G provides a graph-based view that displays a genome with branches and alignments on them. Users can filter, visualize with genomic annotations, and inspect SVs with read alignments.
